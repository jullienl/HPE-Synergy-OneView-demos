# This script sets the password for the netop VC CLI user in the Synergy VC interconnects
#
# Note: netop user is only supported for Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Modules and Virtual Connect SE 100Gb F32 Modules for Synergy.
#
# In OneView 4.20 we change the netop configuration because previously existing default/hardcoded password was considered a security issue. 
#
# New behavior is:
#
# - Existing LE update from earlier version to OV 4.20 or later will preserve the netop/netoppwd user/password combo for all modules
# - New LE in OV 4.20 or later will not have default netop user configured and will require REST API to enable it
#
# Script requirements: Composer 4.20+
# OneView Powershell Library is not required
# 
# Note: If using a OneView Self-signed certificate, it is required to uncomment line 44
# 
# Latest news: Reset-HPOVInterconnectNetOpPassword is now available in the OneView PowerShell library !
