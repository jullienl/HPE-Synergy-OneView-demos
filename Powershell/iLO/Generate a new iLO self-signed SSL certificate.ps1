<# 

This PowerShell script generates a new iLO 4 self-signed SSL certificate on servers having some certificate issues related to the following advisory: 
http://h41302.www4.hp.com/km/saw/view.do?docId=emr_na-a00042194en_us 
(HP Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) - iLO 3 and iLO 4 Self-Signed SSL Certificate May Have an Expiration Date Earlier Than the Issued Date).

After a new iLO certificate is generated, the iLO restarts then the new certificate is imported into OneView and a OneView refresh takes place to update the status of the server using the new certificate.

A RedFish REST command that was added in iLO 4 firmware 2.55 (or later) is used by this script to generate the new self-signed SSL certificate.

Requirements: 
- iLO 4 firmware 2.55 (or later) 
- Latest HPEOneView and HPRESTCmdlets libraries 
- OneView administrator account.
